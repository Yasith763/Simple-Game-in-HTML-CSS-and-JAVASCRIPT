# HTML Simple Game: Final Game

This project is a simple interactive game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game dynamically generates shapes on the screen, and the objective is to click on each shape as quickly as possible to measure your reaction time.

## Features

- **Random Shapes**: Randomly generates shapes (squares or circles) with random colors and sizes on the screen.
